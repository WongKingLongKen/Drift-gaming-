This is an imitation of NS-Shaft that I followed a host on Youtube and made it. It's simply done using Unity and C#. Hope you enjoy the game by downloading the materials needed (it's currently available for mac users only).

## Guidelines on playing the game
* **left arrow**: move to the left of the screen
  
*  **right arrow**: move to the right of the screen
  
*  **play the game again**: press the <kbd>continue<kbd> button on the screen

*  **life**: hitting the spikes on the top or the spike floors reduces the player's life, landing on a blue floor increases the player's life

*   **game over**: falling down to the bottom or running out of the life
